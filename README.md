# What is Adapt-FFB-Joy #

Adapt-FFB-Joy is an AVR microcontroller based device that looks like a joystick with advanced force feedback features in a Windows machine without need for installing any device drivers to PC.

This project contains the software for the AVR microcontroller as well as basic instructions for [building the hardware](https://github.com/tloimu/adapt-ffb-joy/blob/wiki/HowToBuild.md).

Currently, it allows connecting a Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro (FFP) joystick (with a game port connector) to Windows XP/Vista/7/8 (32-bit and 64-bit) as a standard **USB joystick with force feedback** and **no need to install any device drivers**. The adapter also allows to solder a few additional trim pots to work e.g. as elevator trims, aileron trims and rudder pedals in your favorite simulator game.

The adapter has been extensively play tested to work with e.g. IL-2 combat flight simulator. It has also been seen working with other games like Mechwarrior, Rise of Flight, World of Warplanes and War Thunder.

Work is going on to extend the support to MS Sidewinder Force Feedback Wheel also. Some basic support already exists in the project.
